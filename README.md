# Reci-Please
Welcome to Reci-Please! A web app that aims to provide an accessible and fun way for cooks of all ages to discover new recipes to enjoy and share!

## Origin Story
This project was the culmination of group efforts from team __Snackathon__ during the _2021 General Assembly Job Seekers Hackathon_. The challenge was to create a solution that addressed the accesibility needs of the elderly during the holiday season. As a team, we put together Reci-Please to provide our older relatives, friends, and neighbors with a fun and easy way to discover foods and recipes to share with friends and family.
